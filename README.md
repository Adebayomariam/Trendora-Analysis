## Executive Summary
- Trendora lacked a centralized reporting view to monitor customer purchase behavior, product performance, and payment trends. The available data was stored at the transaction level, making it difficult for stakeholders to quickly extract insights.
- An interactive Excel dashboard was developed using PivotTables, PivotCharts, and slicers to track key performance indicators (KPIs) and customer trends. The solution consolidated purchase data from 2,761 customers, enabling real-time filtering and visual analysis.
- The dashboard revealed $164,202 in total revenue with an average customer review rating of 3.75. Dresses and Blouses emerged as the highest-revenue products, customers aged 50–59 were the top spenders, Fall recorded the strongest seasonal sales, and Debit Cards were the most preferred payment method. These insights provide a clear foundation for targeted marketing, inventory optimization, and improved payment strategy.

## The Business Problem
Trendora required a data-driven approach to better understand customer purchasing patterns and product performance. Stakeholders needed to move from raw spreadsheet data to a structured dashboard that supports faster and more informed decision-making.

### Key Questions Addressed:
-	What is the total revenue and customer satisfaction level?
-	Which products generate the most sales?
-	Which customer age groups contribute the highest revenue?
-	Which seasons drive higher spending?
-	What payment methods do customers prefer?

## The Process (Methodology)
### Tools Used:
Microsoft Excel, PivotTables, PivotCharts, Slicers

## Data Sourcing & Overview
The dataset consists of transaction-level customer purchase records, including demographic information, product details, purchase amounts, review ratings, seasonal data, and payment methods.

## Data Cleaning & Transformation (ETL)
The dataset was prepared for analysis by:
-	Standardizing categorical fields such as Season and Payment Method
-	Ensuring consistent formatting for numeric and text columns
-	Removing irregular or incomplete entries
	Creating PivotTables to aggregate revenue by product, age group, season, and payment type
