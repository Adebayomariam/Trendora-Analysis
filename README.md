## Executive Summary
- Trendora lacked a centralized reporting view to monitor customer purchase behavior, product performance, and payment trends. The available data was stored at the transaction level, making it difficult for stakeholders to quickly extract insights.
- An interactive Excel dashboard was developed using PivotTables, PivotCharts, and slicers to track key performance indicators (KPIs) and customer trends. The solution consolidated purchase data from 2,761 customers, enabling real-time filtering and visual analysis.
- The dashboard revealed $164,202 in total revenue with an average customer review rating of 3.75. Dresses and Blouses emerged as the highest-revenue products, customers aged 50–59 were the top spenders, Fall recorded the strongest seasonal sales, and Debit Cards were the most preferred payment method. These insights provide a clear foundation for targeted marketing, inventory optimization, and improved payment strategy.
